## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tickity/contracts
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
forge install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and RPC URLs
```

### Compilation

```bash
forge build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test test_PurchaseTicket

# Run tests with verbose output
forge test -vvv
```

### Deployment

1. Set your private key in environment:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

2. Deploy to Etherlink testnet:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url https://node.ghostnet.etherlink.com --broadcast --verify
```

3. Deploy to Etherlink mainnet:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url https://node.mainnet.etherlink.com --broadcast --verify
```

## Contract Addresses

After deployment, the following contracts will be deployed:

- **TickityNFT**: Main NFT contract
- **EventFactory**: Factory for creating events
- **TickityMarketplace**: Secondary marketplace

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Event

```solidity
// Through EventFactory
address eventAddress = factoryContract.createEvent(
    "Concert Night",
    "Amazing live music event",
    block.timestamp + 7 days,
    block.timestamp + 8 days,
    "Music Hall",
    1000,
    ["VIP", "General"],
    [0.1 ether, 0.05 ether],
    [100, 900],
    address(nftContract)
);
```

### Purchasing a Ticket

```solidity
// Through Event contract
eventContract.purchaseTicket{value: 0.05 ether}(1); // General ticket
```

### Listing on Marketplace

```solidity
// Approve marketplace
nftContract.approve(address(marketplaceContract), tokenId);

// List ticket
marketplaceContract.listTicket{value: 0.001 ether}(tokenId, 0.08 ether);
```

## Testing

The test suite covers:

- Contract deployment
- Event creation and management
- Ticket purchasing and validation
- Marketplace functionality
- Security scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions

Run tests with:

```bash
forge test
```

**Current Status**: âœ… All 10 tests passing

## Security Considerations

- All contracts use OpenZeppelin's battle-tested libraries
- Reentrancy protection on all external calls
- Access control for sensitive functions
- Input validation and bounds checking
- Emergency pause functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Gas Optimization

- Efficient storage patterns
- Optimized loops and data structures
- Minimal external calls
- Batch operations where possible
